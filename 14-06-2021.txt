**1. Write a simple program for nested comments. what is the error & how we resolve it?**
Ans:  #include<stdio.h>
      int main()
      {
            /*Trying to make a nested comment
    
            /*This is the inner nested comment*/
    
            This the end of outer nested comment*/
            
          return 0;
      }
    
    Here both the outer nested comment and the inner one will be terminate at the same time when '*/' is met , 
    hence the last line will not be comment resulting in an error.
    
    To resolve this issue we can use the '//' symbol for the inner comment , here is an example
    
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
        /*Trying to make a nested comment

        //This is the inner nested comment

        This the end of outer nested comment*/

        return 0;
    }
    
**2. A block of code is given to you and comment out all the code.**
Ans:We can comment out a block of code by covering it within #if 0 and #endif.
    Example:
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
      #if 0
      
      This is within the if 0 definition hence will be not be compiled.
      
      #endif
      return 0;
    }

**3. execute the following code and note down the outputs.**

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char c1,c2,c3;
    c1=65;
    c2='b';
    c3='3';
    printf("c1 = %c\n",c1);
    printf("c2 = %c\n",c2);
    printf("c3 = %c\n",c3);
    printf("c1 = %d\n",c1);
    printf("c2 = %d\n",c2);
    printf("c3 = %d\n",c3);
    return 0;
}

Ans:c1 = A
    c2 = b
    c3 = 3
    c1 = 65
    c2 = 98
    c3 = 51
