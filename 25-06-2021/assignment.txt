1.Go to the printf implementation and find out why we are getting junk ?
Answer :   Because printf function expects format specifier.
  
2.Conclude structure copy of C is shallow copy or deep copy?
Answer :  Using assignment operators on structers results in a shallow copy.

3.Draw the memorry layout for big & little endian and map the variables from the given program!
#include <stdio.h>
union{
    int x;
    short sh;
    char c[2];
    char ch[4];
}var;

int main()
{
    var.x = 0x12345678;
    printf("0x%x 0x%x 0x%x\n",var.sh,var.c[0],var.c[1]);
    printf("0x%x 0x%x 0x%x 0x%x\n",var.ch[0],var.ch[1],var.ch[2],var.ch[3]);
    return 0;
}

Answer : 
a) In case of little-endian the output will be : 
    0x5678 0x78 0x56
    0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12
b) In case of big-endian the output will be :
    0x1234 0x12 0x34
    0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78
    
4.List out the applications of Union?
Answer : Unions can be used in case the same memory address has to be shared by variables of different data types for example hardware input/output access, bitfield and word sharing, or type punning..
